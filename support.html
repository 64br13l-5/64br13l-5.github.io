<h2>Q. What and When does the App Record? </h2>
<p>A. The app only records while the toggle is on, and only while the app is running in the background or foreground. It also only keeps the last (X) seconds of your data at any given time (where X is user designated) so your data isn't being stored anywhere. None of the recording data is being sent to any server or kept anywhere aside from locally on your phone or ipad.</x></p>

<h2>Q. What Makes this App Different from Voice Memos?</h2> 
<p>A. While voice memos saves the entire duration of the recording, this only saves the past time. This is much lighter on memory and battery, and is easier for saving specific moments. Also this app is more robust when it comes to recording in the background without interrupts.</p> 

<h2>Q. What Does the Big Red Button Do?</h2>
<p>A. Yes, this was a real question asked by my father (Boomer), and it saves a recording if you couldn't have guessed. </p>
